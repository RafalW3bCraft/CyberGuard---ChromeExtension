## Temporary Icon Solution
Until proper icons are designed, the extension will use text-based icons (ðŸ”´) in the interface.
The manifest references these files, so they should be created for full functionality.

## Creation Tools
Recommended tools for creating these icons:
- GIMP (free)
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Canva (with cyber/tech templates)
- Online icon generators with cyberpunk themes
